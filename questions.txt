Why use adam what are these eqautions?
methods to optimizations categpry wise (inital values,boundary conditions,-inf to inf,)
why did we converge to these two methods
All libraries which we define And their funtions which we use specifically
From begnning to end summarize review of code in flowchart (we do this than that and explain each steps)
How did we decide the final result direction of answer
        values of SSE,RMSE,R^2,adjusted R^2 from Matlab and explain these errors in details
        And prove mathematically how are a,b,c,d parameters are better (by comaporing the results of our code and matlab)
Use of AI/ML(optimization) in this task
Is there any tradeoff? 



Why ADAM+LBFGS is better than trustregion algorithm.(State Reason)
        Similarity between two
        Difference " "
        WHat is used in ADAM+LBFGS that it gives better result than trustregion



FORMAT:
Title: Optimization of Feno paramaeter in Ring Resonator Based Photonic Integrated Circuits.
Abstarct: 
Introduction: About Ring Resonator Based Photonic Integrated Circuits(Wiki),
                What is Feno resonance and Feno Paramater
                Role of basic Optimization in Photonic Integrated Circuits(Wiki)
                What we are plannin to do-> In this Internship we optimized the q parameter to obtaining a better curve fit for feno resonance

Matematical Modelling: First Para from Conference paper 
                        How did we obtain a better 'q' paramet than matlab (answers of last three questions)

Procedure(use better word for procedure):
Results and Discussions: insert RMSE ,SSE,R2,Adj-R2 table
                        WHat value of q parameter we obtained
                        What does this show(Result section in conference paper)
Future Scope: We have tried it optimizing using NN but training in Physics Informed Equations still is under processing
