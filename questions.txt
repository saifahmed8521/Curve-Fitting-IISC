Why use adam what are these eqautions?
methods to optimizations categpry wise (inital values,boundary conditions,-inf to inf,)
why did we converge to these two methods
All libraries which we define And their funtions which we use specifically
From begnning to end summarize review of code in flowchart (we do this than that and explain each steps)
How did we decide the final result direction of answer
        values of SSE,RMSE,R^2,adjusted R^2 from Matlab and explain these errors in details
        And prove mathematically how are a,b,c,d parameters are better (by comaporing the results of our code and matlab)
Use of AI/ML(optimization) in this task
Is there any tradeoff?
